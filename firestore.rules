/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, ensuring users can only access their own resources.
 * It allows public read access to user profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible for reading by any user, but writable only by the owner.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages. Accessible for reading by any user, but only the sender can create. Only the sender and recipient can update message status. Only the sender can delete messages.
 * - /chats/{userId}: Tracks active chat IDs for each user, accessible and writable only by the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/todos/{todoId}: Stores to-do items for each user, accessible and writable only by the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/reports/{reportId}: Stores performance reports for each user, accessible and writable only by the owner.
 * - /clientLeads/{leadId}: Stores client leads for the organization, accessible to any authenticated user.
 * - /marketingContent/{contentId}: Stores marketing content for the organization, accessible to any authenticated user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly allowed to display user profiles.
 * - Users have full CRUD access only to data under their own /users/{userId} subcollection.
 * - Active chats, to-do items and reports are secured under the owner's user ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - To-Do and Report documents denormalize the `userId` to simplify ownership checks.
